# WOWCAM
A simple World of Warcraft addon manager for CurseForge addons

#### Under construction

The new WOWCAM tool ("_**W**orld **o**f **W**arcraft **C**urse **A**ddon **M**anager_") is being built here...

WOWCAM is the official next generation [WADM](https://github.com/MBODM/WADM) and to achieve this goal it combines [WADH](https://github.com/MBODM/WADH) and [WAUZ](https://github.com/MBODM/WAUZ) into a single and simple-to-use tool.

Promises:
- It will make WoW addon mangement great again!
- It has an "unzip-only" fallback mode, if https://curseforge.com change stuff again.
- It will NOT be that "Windows default style" ugly as f**k.

In short: Work in progress...

#### Have fun.
